*A professional tool for managing Augment extension trial periods*

</div>

## 📋 Overview

This tool provides a reliable solution for resetting the trial period of the Augment coding extension. It works seamlessly with both VS Code and Cursor editors, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Aggressive Trial Reset**: Wipes all known config and cache data for a true reset
- 🛠️ **Multi-Editor Support**: Works with both VS Code and Cursor
- 🔒 **Secure**: No data is sent to external servers
- 💾 **Backup System**: Automatically backs up your configuration
- 🎯 **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 🕒 **Custom Trial Duration**: Use `--days N` to set your trial period (maximum 14 days; higher values will be capped)
- 🧹 **Identity File Wipe**: Removes identity-related files for both VS Code and Cursor to further reduce tracking
- 🛡️ **Improved Safety**: Aggressively deletes all stale data before resetting

## 💰 Cost Savings

The Augment extension costs $20/month ($240/year). This tool helps you:
- Save $240 annually
- Get unlimited trial periods
- Access premium features for free
- No subscription required

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified & Wiped
- `state.json`: Trial state and configuration
- `subscription.json`: Subscription information
- `account.json`: Account settings
- All related `augment.augment` folders in globalStorage, Cache, and CachedData

### System Requirements
- Node.js runtime
- VS Code or Cursor editor
- Administrative privileges (system-dependent)
- **Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install required packages (`chalk`, `inquirer`)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Each reset requires a new account
- Resets the device trial counter to zero
- Must be run with editor closed
- The maximum allowed trial period is 14 days. If you specify a higher value, the tool will warn you and use 14 days instead.
- The tool now wipes identity-related files in both VS Code and Cursor config directories (logs, history, workspaceStorage) to further reduce tracking.

> **Note:** The custom trial duration feature is not guaranteed to work in all cases. The Augment extension may enforce trial limits server-side or change its validation methods at any time. This tool attempts to reset all local data, but results may vary depending on future updates to the extension.

## 🔒 Security Features

- Local file modifications only
- Automatic configuration backups
- No external data transmission
- Timestamped backup files
