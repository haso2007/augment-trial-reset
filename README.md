This tool provides a reliable solution for resetting the trial period of the Augment coding extension. It works seamlessly with both VS Code and Cursor editors, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Aggressive Trial Reset**: Wipes all known config and cache data for a true reset
- üõ†Ô∏è **Multi-Editor Support**: Works with both VS Code and Cursor
- üîí **Secure**: No data is sent to external servers
- üíæ **Backup System**: Automatically backs up your configuration
- üéØ **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

- üßπ **Identity File Wipe**: Removes identity-related files for both VS Code and Cursor to further reduce tracking
- üõ°Ô∏è **Improved Safety**: Aggressively deletes all stale data before resetting

## üí∞ Cost Savings

The Augment extension costs $20/month ($240/year). This tool helps you:
- Save $240 annually
- Get unlimited trial periods
- Access premium features for free
- No subscription required

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified & Wiped
- `state.json`: Trial state and configuration
- `subscription.json`: Subscription information
- `account.json`: Account settings
- All related `augment.augment` folders in globalStorage, Cache, and CachedData

### System Requirements
- Node.js runtime

- Administrative privileges (system-dependent)
- **Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install required packages (`chalk`, `inquirer`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Each reset requires a new account
- Resets the device trial counter to zero
- Must be run with editor closed
- The maximum allowed trial period is 14 days. If you specify a higher value, the tool will warn you and use 14 days instead.
- The tool now wipes identity-related files in both VS Code and Cursor config directories (logs, history, workspaceStorage) to further reduce tracking.

> **Note:** The custom trial duration feature is not guaranteed to work in all cases. The Augment extension may enforce trial limits server-side or change its validation methods at any time. This tool attempts to reset all local data, but results may vary depending on future updates to the extension.
